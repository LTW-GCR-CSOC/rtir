This directory contain files required for the translation
of RTIR interfaces.

po/rtir.pot is a template.

To start a new translation, copy the template to po/<lang>.po where <lang>
is your language, for example ru, pt, pt_BR or other.

There are currently no translations to any language, so you may encounter
some problems.

Some strings may be missing from the rtir.pot file.  This may happen if a
developer forgot to use loc function or /l mason component. Usually it's
easy to fix. Find the string in the source, wrap it into call to the
function or the component. You can find examples of using these all over the
code. Then update message catalogs using the directions above.
