# If there is no global queue custom field called RTIR_Constituency, create one
# add the constituency name to as a value for that field
#
# Create four queues
#   $CONSTITUENCY Investigations
#   $CONSTITUENCY Reports
#   $CONSTITUENCY Incidents
#   $CONSTITUENCY Countermeasures 
#   
#       For each of those queues
#           set its RTIR constituency to $CONSTITUENCY
#           apply the RTIR scrips for its kind of queue to it
#           Create a dutyteam group for it $CONSTITUENCY Duty Team
#           Create a readonly group for it $CONSTITUENCY Read Only
#           Give the duty team the correct rights
