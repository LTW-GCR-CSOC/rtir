=head1 Upgrading to 3.2

The following describes some of the key components of the upgrade
to RTIR 3.2 from previous versions of RTIR, specifically
from RTIR 3.0. The other UPGRADING documents contain details
for previous versions.

=head2 F<add_constituency> Moved

The F<add_constituency> script has been moved from F<etc> to the standard
F<bin> directory.

=head2 Chart URLs changed

RT 4.2 added improved charting (multiple group bys, calculations, etc),
but the arguments passed have changed. If you have bookmarks pointing to
/RTIR/Search/Reporting.html they likely will not work on RTIR 3.2.

=head2 Incident Due Dates

It is now possible to edit the Due date of Incidents manually, however
editing a child's Due Date will overwrite this (and Incident Due dates are
not copied down to Children).

=head2 C<$RTIRSearchResultFormats> now C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats>

If you've copied $RTIRSearchResultFormats to your RTIR_SiteConfig.pm,
you should switch to using %RTIRSearchResultFormats.  You no longer need
to copy the entire configuration option just to change one or two of the
formats (documented in RTIR_SiteConfig.pm) so you can merge your
customizations together with our new entries and avoid copying defaults.

=head2 Linking an IR to an Incident now copies IPs

When creating an Incident from an Incident Report, RTIR would helpfully
copy the IP for you, but didn't do so if you later added another IR to
an existing Incident.  If you do no want this behavior, it is controlled
by the "On Linking To Incident Copy IPs" scrip in the Incident Report
Queue.


=head1 UPGRADING FROM 3.2.0 AND EARLIER

RTIR 3.2.0 and earlier set an unlimited value for the core setting
C<MaxInlineBody>, overriding the default of 12k.  This could cause
performance problems on large emails with large numbers of IP addresses,
URLs, or other MakeClicky targets.  RTIR now sets a C<MaxInlineBody> of
25k.
