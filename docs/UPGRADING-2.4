=head1 Upgrading to 2.4

The following describes some of the key components of the upgrade
to RTIR 2.4 from all previous versions of RTIR.

The F<etc/upgrade/rtir-2.4-upgrade.pl> script is mentioned several times
for different versions. You only need to run it once and the most
recent version is now included in the RTIR distribution.

=head1 Upgrading from 2.3.17 and Earlier

=head2 RT Extension Location

The layout of files in RT's directories was changed in RT 3.8.0.
Each extension is now installed in its own directory and is activated
using the @Plugins option in the RT config.

=head2 RTFM's Response Custom Field

RTFM's Response custom field could be created with MaxValues = 0,
which is incorrect and should be changed to 1. Run the following query to
update the DB.

    UPDATE CustomFields SET MaxValues = 1 WHERE
            Name = 'Response'
            AND Type = 'Text'
            AND LookupType = 'RT::FM::Class-RT::FM::Article'
            AND MaxValues = 0;

=head1 Upgrading from 2.3.15 and Earlier

There was an error in an earlier version of the F<etc/upgrade/rtir-2.4-upgrade.pl>
script where it could skip some incidents during upgrade. Run the new version
of this script, especially if you never ran it or ran with earlier versions
of RTIR.

This script updates Due dates on active incidents where it's not set and
sets it to the most recent due date of the active children.

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/2.3.0

Run the upgrade scripts where we split out incidents owned by Nobody and
the Current User on the most-due views on the homepage.

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/2.1.1

Run the upgrade scripts where we add several scrips that set 'Started'
date of tickets in RTIR.

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/2.1.0

Run the upgrade scripts where we do following:

=over

=item 1

Apply the _RTIR_IP CF to all RTIR's queues and convert it to
multiple type. Also, we add several scrips to parse IP addresses
from incomming mails and to fill those into the CF.

=item 2

The constituency field we apply to all RTIR's queues too and
and add several scrips to track values of the field.

=back

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/1.9.0

Run the upgrade scripts where we do following:

=over

=item 1

The LaunchMessage template in the Investigations queue
has been renamed to Autoreply without any changes of the content.
This upgrade step is automated, but may fail if you've changed
the LaunchMessage template.

=item 2

In the Blocks queue an Autoreply template has been added. This is
a replacement for the NewMessage template. The automated step
doesn't delete the old template. You have to check that the new
template suits your needs, maybe copy customizations from the old
one, then delete the NewMessage template.

=item 3

NotifyOnLaunch and NotifyOnCreate scrips have been deleted in
the Implementations and the Blocks queues respectively. You have to
use the default RT's Autoreply scrip instead or create autoreply
scrips in these queues if the global one is disabled or doesn't exist.
You need the following scrip in the queues:

    On Create AutoReply to Requestors with Template Autoreply

=item 4

The new 'BlockRemoved' template has been added in the Blocks
queue. Check its content.

=back

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/1.1.3

Run the upgrade scripts where we install several new actions,
conditions and scrips that had been introduced in RTIR 1.1.3.
Also, we change the action for 'SetDueReopen' scrips.

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/1.1.1

Run the upgrade scripts where we do following:

=over

=item 1

Switch from 'UserDefined' actions and conditions
to modules, so all code is in the lib directory. If you changed
the code of the scrips then you have to port changes.

=item 2

Run the F<etc/upgrade/rtir-2.4-upgrade.pl> script. This script updates Due Dates
on active incidents where they are not set and sets them to the most
recent due date of the active children.

=back

=head1 Applying Changes from upgrade/1.0.3

Run the upgrade scripts where we grant the ShowTemplate right to
the DutyTeam group.

=head1 Upgrading from RTIR 1.0.0

RTIR now installs in RT's local/plugins/RT-IR directory rather than
local/html, making local modifications to RTIR easier. Do the following:

=over

=item 1

IMPORTANT! Back up any modifications that you've made to the
F</opt/rt3/local/html/RTIR> directory.

=item 2

Remove the old RTIR files and install everything into clean directory
as described in the install instructions. B<Do not> run the database
init step.
